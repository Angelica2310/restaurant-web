The Banh Xeo was perfectly crispy and the chicken and prawn inside nice and soft and not overcooked. The pho bo is super fragrant and the bun hue is even better with nice kick of spice reminded me of bun hue I had on the street outside hotel in Ho Chi Minh City. The coffee is standout, I think the best hot Vietnamese coffee I’ve had in England.",

The spring rolls are quite extraordinary – so crispy and full of flavour, like none I've ever had before. We always get the salt and chilli tofu as well, which is so light and fluffy. Really like the vermicelli salad noodles dishes as well, which are so beautifully fresh tasting. Such a warm and friendly atmosphere, it's always a pleasure to visit!",
